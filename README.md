# WebKaroke
Project to learn Python Flask Web Framework.  Users will be able to create LRC files or upload an existing one for karoke in the browser.

Current Features:
* Can parse any generic LRC file.  While audio file is playing, it will run the proper animations on a per-line basis.  (Do not have an enhanced .LRC file that has timings for words yet)
