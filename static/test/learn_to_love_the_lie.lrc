[00:21.40]I wish it was just another day
[00:24.10]Another ordinary, not extraordinary
[00:26.50]Just a boring Sunday morning
[00:28.50]When doing nothing’s the only something we’ve got planned
[00:31.60]But not today
[00:33.50]We're falling apart and it's showing that we're
[00:37.00]Basically just trapped in captivity
[00:39.40]Wishing our way out
[00:41.00]Just let me cross my fingers behind my back
[00:45.50]And I’ll swear on anything you want me to after that
[00:49.50]I’ve heard that if I cross my heart then I’d have to die
[00:54.80]If you don’t want to say goodbye
[00:57.80]Then I guess you’ll have to learn to love the lie
[01:01.62]You and me, we’re really nothing but enemies
[01:06.26]Pretending we're not meant to be
[01:09.63]I don’t want to be the one to stay
[01:11.98]I don’t want to be the one that got away
[01:15.30]And if I’m being honest
[01:16.93]You couldn’t get rid of me anyway
[01:19.00]I don’t want to be the one to stay
[01:20.94]What the hell, for heaven's sake
[01:23.74]I don’t want to be the one that got away
[01:27.73]If Massachusetts had a loyalty
[01:32.26]I hope it wouldn’t choose you over me
[01:36.43]And if you’re wondering what keeps me up at night
[01:40.67]It's thinking that you might be right
[01:43.39]Just let me cross my fingers behind my back
[01:47.89]And I’ll swear on anything you want me to after that
[01:51.82]I’ve heard that if I cross my heart then I’d have to die
[01:57.18]If you don’t want to say goodbye
[02:00.06]Then I guess you’ll have to learn to love the lie
[02:03.56]You and me, we’re really nothing but enemies
[02:08.31]Pretending that’s exactly how it's supposed to be
[02:12.08]I don’t want to be the one to stay
[02:14.69]I don’t want to be the one that got away
[02:17.42]And if I’m being honest
[02:19.01]You couldn’t get rid of me anyway
[02:21.31]I don’t want to be the one to stay
[02:23.19]What the hell, for heaven's sake
[02:25.82]I don’t want to be the one that got away
[02:31.27]You can say what you want about me
[02:34.50]The old me would not apologize
[02:40.44]You can do what you want without me
[02:43.75]If only I could keep us from colliding
[02:47.32]Overanalyzing
[02:50.31]Every move we make we think we're just surviving
[02:54.30]But slowly we were dying
[02:57.36]Until the rattle somehow brings us back to life
[03:01.70]So let's learn to love the lie
[03:05.26]I don’t want to be the one to stay
[03:07.47]I don’t want to be the one that got away
[03:10.52]And if I’m being honest
[03:12.11]You couldn’t get rid of me anyway
[03:14.42]I don’t want to be the one to stay
[03:16.28]What the hell, for heaven's sake
[03:19.00]I don’t want to be the one that got away
[03:23.90]I don’t want to be the one that got away
[03:28.40]I don’t want to be the one that got away
[03:36.98]But we have to laugh to learn to love the lie
[03:41.50]
