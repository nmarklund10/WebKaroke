[00:21.36]I wish it was just another day
[00:23.60]
[00:23.69]Another ordinary, not extraordinary
[00:26.09]
[00:26.37]Just a boring Sunday morning
[00:28.28]
[00:28.37]When doing nothing's the only something we've got planned
[00:31.34]
[00:31.60]But not today
[00:33.04]
[00:33.41]We're falling apart and it's showing that we're
[00:36.86]
[00:36.96]Basically just trapped in captivity
[00:39.21]
[00:39.30]Wishing our way out
[00:40.53]
[00:41.01]Just let me cross my fingers behind my back
[00:44.72]
[00:45.53]And I'll swear on anything you want me to after that
[00:48.80]
[00:49.27]I've heard that if I cross my heart then I'd have to die
[00:53.91]
[00:54.78]If you don't want to say goodbye
[00:56.57]
[00:57.66]Then I guess you'll have to learn to love the lie
[01:00.60]
[01:01.23]You and me, we're really nothing but enemies
[01:05.64]
[01:06.32]Pretending we're not meant to be
[01:09.32]
[01:09.58]I don't want to be the one to stay
[01:11.53]
[01:11.88]I don't want to be the one that got away
[01:14.36]
[01:15.03]And if I'm being honest
[01:16.44]
[01:16.72]You couldn't get rid of me anyway
[01:18.46]
[01:18.96]I don't want to be the one to stay
[01:20.70]
[01:20.87]What the hell, for heaven's sake
[01:22.91]
[01:23.44]I don't want to be the one that got away
[01:25.89]
[01:27.67]If Massachusetts had a loyalty
[01:30.79]
[01:32.24]I hope it wouldn't choose you over me
[01:35.09]
[01:36.66]And if you're wondering what keeps me up at night
[01:39.67]
[01:40.37]It's thinking that you might be right
[01:42.86]
[01:43.25]Just let me cross my fingers behind my back
[01:47.28]
[01:47.81]And I'll swear on anything you want me to after that
[01:51.35]
[01:51.80]I've heard that if I cross my heart then I'd have to die
[01:56.37]
[01:56.95]If you don't want to say goodbye
[01:58.72]
[01:59.98]Then I guess you'll have to learn to love the lie
[02:03.00]
[02:03.59]You and me, we're really nothing but enemies
[02:07.73]
[02:08.23]Pretending that's exactly how it's supposed to be
[02:11.42]
[02:12.03]I don't want to be the one to stay
[02:13.89]
[02:14.23]I don't want to be the one that got away
[02:16.90]
[02:17.28]And if I'm being honest
[02:19.03]
[02:19.03]You couldn't get rid of me anyway
[02:20.91]
[02:21.24]I don't want to be the one to stay
[02:22.86]
[02:23.17]What the hell, for heaven's sake
[02:25.39]
[02:25.77]I don't want to be the one that got away
[02:28.26]
[02:31.15]You can say what you want about me
[02:33.31]
[02:34.49]The old me would not apologize
[02:37.71]
[02:40.23]You can do what you want without me
[02:42.69]
[02:43.68]If only I could keep us from colliding
[02:47.18]
[02:47.80]Overanalyzing
[02:49.64]
[02:50.38]Every move we make we think we're just surviving
[02:54.13]
[02:54.20]But slowly we were dying
[02:56.62]
[02:57.26]Until the rattle somehow brings us back to life
[03:00.42]
[03:01.66]So let's learn to love the lie
[03:04.80]
[03:05.16]I don't want to be the one to stay
[03:06.85]
[03:07.32]I don't want to be the one that got away
[03:09.78]
[03:10.35]And if I'm being honest
[03:11.98]
[03:12.24]You couldn't get rid of me anyway
[03:14.01]
[03:14.35]I don't want to be the one to stay
[03:16.22]
[03:16.24]What the hell, for heaven's sake
[03:18.35]
[03:18.83]I don't want to be the one that got away
[03:21.02]
[03:23.71]I don't want to be the one that got away
[03:26.01]
[03:28.15]I don't want to be the one that got away (if I cross my heart then I'd have to die)
[03:33.82]
[03:34.04]But I don't wanna say goodbye
[03:35.82]
[03:36.94]But we have to love to learn to love the lie
[03:41.26]
